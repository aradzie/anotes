!front: What is an infinite sequence?
!back:
An infinite sequence is an ordered and indexed list of numbers of the form

\[ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n, \ldots \]

denoted as

\[ \{ a_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \]

or simply

\[ \{ a_n \}. \]

Each number \(a_n\) is a term of the sequence.

The subscript \(n\) is the index variable of the sequence.

!front: What are the different ways to define a sequence?
!back:
An infinite sequence can be defined in various ways:

- By listing terms \(\{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \}\).

- By an explicit formula that defines the \(n\)-th term directly in terms of \(n\), \(a_n = f(n)\).

- By a recurrence relation, a rule that defines a term based on previous terms in the sequence, \(a_n = f(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots)\).

!front: What is the limit of a sequence?
!back:
A sequence \(\{ a_n \}\) converges to a real number \(L\) if for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(|a_n − L| < \epsilon\) if \(n \ge N\). The number \(L\) is the limit of the sequence and we write

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L \text{ or } a_n \to L. \]

In this case, we say the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is a **convergent sequence**. If a sequence does not converge, it is a **divergent sequence**, and we say the limit does not exist.

!front: What is the squeeze theorem for sequences?
!back:
Consider sequences \(\{a_n\}\), \(\{b_n\}\), and \(\{c_n\}\).
Suppose there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(a_n \le b_n \le c_n\) for all \(n \ge N\).
If there exists a real number \(L\) such that

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L = \lim_{n \to \infty} c_n, \]

then \(\{b_n\}\) converges and

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = L \]

!front: What is a bounded sequence?
!back:
A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is **bounded above** if there exists a real number \(M\) such that

\[ a_n \le M \]

for all positive integers \(n\).

A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is *bounded below* if there exists a real number \(M\) such that

\[ M \le a_n \]

for all positive integers \(n\).

A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is a *bounded sequence* if it is bounded above and bounded below.

If a sequence is not bounded, it is an **unbounded sequence**.

!front: What is a monotone sequence?
!back:
A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is **increasing** for all \(n \ge n_0\) if

\[ a_n \le a_{n+1} \text{ for all } n \ge n_0. \]

A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is **decreasing** for all \(n \ge n_0\) if

\[ a_n \ge a_{n+1} \text{ for all } n \ge n_0. \]

A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is a **monotone sequence** for all \(n \ge n_0\) if it is increasing for all \(n \ge n_0\) or decreasing for all \(n \ge n_0\).

!front: What is the monotone convergence theorem?

!front: What is the telescoping series?
!back:
The telescoping series is an infinite series of the following form

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n - a_{n+1}. \]

In other words, the telescoping series is a series in which most of the terms cancel in each of the partial sums, leaving only some of the first terms and some of the last terms.

!front: What are the algebraic properties of convergent series?
!back:
Let \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) be convergent series. Then the following algebraic properties hold.

- Sum Rule: The series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n + b_n)\) converges and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n + b_n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\).

- Difference Rule: The series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n - b_n)\) converges and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n - b_n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\).

- Constant Multiple Rule: For any real number \(c\), the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c a_n\) converges and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c a_n = c \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\).

!front: What is the divergence test for a series?
!back:
Consider the sequence \(a_n\). If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0\) or \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n\) does not exist, then the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.

The converse is not true. That is, if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\), we cannot make any conclusion about the convergence of \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\).

!front: What is the integral test?
!back:
Suppose \(\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n\) is a series with positive terms \(a_n\). Suppose there exists a function \(f\) and a positive integer \(N\) such that the following three conditions are satisfied:

- \(f\) is continuous,

- \(f\) is decreasing, and

- \(f(n) = a_n\) for all integers \(n \ge N\).

Then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) and \(\int_{N}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx\) both converge or both diverge.

Although convergence of the integral implies convergence of the related series, it does not imply that the value of the integral and the series are the same.

Suppose there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(a_n \ge b_n \ge 0\) for all \(n \ge N\). If \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) diverges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n/b_n = \infty\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) diverges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.

!back:

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1} a_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - \ldots \]

A series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) exhibits **conditional convergence** if \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges but \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|\) diverges.

If \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|\) converges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges.
